     <h1>Introduction to Samurais</h1><br><br>
    <p>Samurai (侍、さむらい) were the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s during the Meiji era. They were the well-paid retainers of the daimyo, the great feudal landholders. They had high prestige and special privileges.<br><br>

Following the passing of a law in 1629, samurai on official duty were required to practice daishō (wear two swords). Samurai were granted kiri-sute gomen: the right to kill anyone of a lower class in certain situations. Some important samurai and other figures in Japanese history wanted others to believe all of them engaged combatants using bushido codes of martial virtues and followed various cultural ideals about how a samurai should act.<br><br>

Although they had predecessors in earlier military and administrative officers, the samurai truly emerged during the Kamakura shogunate, ruling from c.1185 to 1333. They became the ruling political class, with significant power but also significant responsibility. During the 13th century, the samurai proved themselves as adept warriors against the invading Mongols. During the peaceful Edo period, 1603 to 1868, they became the stewards and chamberlains of the daimyo estates, gaining managerial experience and education.<br><br>

In the 1870s, samurai families comprised 5% of the population. As modern militaries emerged in the 19th century, the samurai were rendered increasingly obsolete and very expensive to maintain compared to the average conscript soldier. The Meiji Restoration ended their feudal roles, and they moved into professional and entrepreneurial roles. Their memory and weaponry remain prominent in Japanese popular culture.<br><br>

Terminology
In Japanese, historical warriors are usually referred to as bushi (武士, [bɯ.ɕi]), meaning 'warrior', or buke (武家), meaning 'military family'. According to translator William Scott Wilson: "In Chinese, the character 侍 was originally a verb meaning 'to wait upon', 'accompany persons' in the upper ranks of society, and this is also true of the original term in Japanese, saburau. In both countries the terms were nominalized to mean 'those who serve in close attendance to the nobility', the Japanese term saburai being the nominal form of the verb." According to Wilson, an early reference to the word saburai appears in the Kokin Wakashū, the first imperial anthology of poems, completed in the early 900s.<br><br>

In modern usage, bushi is often used as a synonym for samurai; however, historical sources make it clear that bushi and samurai were distinct concepts, with the former referring to soldiers or warriors and the latter referring instead to a kind of hereditary nobility. The word samurai is now closely associated with the middle and upper echelons of the warrior class. These warriors were usually associated with a clan and their lord, and were trained as officers in military tactics and grand strategy. While these samurai numbered less than 10% of then Japan's population,[14] their teachings can still be found today in both everyday life and in modern Japanese martial arts.<br><br></p>

    <h3><strong><em>Opens Curtains</em></strong></h3>
    <h2>Prologue</h2>
    <p><strong>Two households, both alike in dignity,
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
        Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br><br>
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
        And the continuance of their parents' rage,
        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
        The which if you with patient ears attend,
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</strong></p>

        <H1><em>Closing Prologue, opening ACT 1</em></H1>
        <p><em>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</em></p>
       <strong>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
        SAMPSON:
            Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            No, for then we should be colliers.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            I strike quickly, being moved.<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            But thou art not quickly moved to strike.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            A dog of the house of Montague moves me.<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
            therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
            take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
            to the wall.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
            are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
            Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
            to the wall.<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
            have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
            maids, and cut off their heads.<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            The heads of the maids?<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
            take it in what sense thou wilt.<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            They must take it in sense that feel it.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
            'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
            hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
            two of the house of the Montagues.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            How! turn thy back and run?<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            Fear me not.<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            No, marry; I fear thee!<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.<br><br>

            GREGORY:
            I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
            they list.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
            which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
            Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR<br><br>
            
            ABRAHAM:
            Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            I do bite my thumb, sir.<br><br>
            ABRAHAM:
            Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
            ay?<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            No.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
            bite my thumb, sir.<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            Do you quarrel, sir?<br><br>
            ABRAHAM:
            Quarrel sir! no, sir.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.<br><br>
            ABRAHAM:
            No better.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            Well, sir.<br><br>
            GREGORY:
            Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            Yes, better, sir.<br><br>
            ABRAHAM:
            You lie.<br><br>
            SAMPSON:
            Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
            They fight<br><br>
            
            Enter BENVOLIO
            
            BENVOLIO:
            Part, fools!
            Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
            Beats down their swords<br><br>
            
            Enter TYBALT
            
            TYBALT:
            What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
            Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.<br><br>
            BENVOLIO:
            I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
            Or manage it to part these men with me.<br><br>
            TYBALT:
            What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
            As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
            Have at thee, coward!
            They fight<br><br>
            
            Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs<br><br>
            
            First Citizen:
            Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
            Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
            Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET<br><br>
            
            CAPULET:
            What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!<br><br>
            LADY CAPULET:
            A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?<br><br>
            CAPULET:
            My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
            And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
            Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE<br><br>
            
            MONTAGUE:
            Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.<br><br>
            LADY MONTAGUE:
            Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
            Enter PRINCE, with Attendants<br><br>
            
            PRINCE:
            Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
            Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
            Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
            That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
            With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
            On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
            Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
            And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
            Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
            By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
            Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,<br><br>
            And made Verona's ancient citizens
            Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
            To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
            Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
            If ever you disturb our streets again,
            Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
            For this time, all the rest depart away:
            You Capulet; shall go along with me:
            And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
            To know our further pleasure in this case,
            To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
            Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
            Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO<br><br>
            
            MONTAGUE:
            Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
            Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? </strong></p>
